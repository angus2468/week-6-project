# Week 6 project - Recreating the cookie clicker we made in react

I completed all of the base requirements with no probelms with completing these.
I then completed a couple stretch goals:

- I completed the stretch goal of having the game data save when the app is closed by storing the information the the local storage.
- I completed the stretch goal of retrieving the shop data from the upgrades API provided.
- I also completed a self made stretch goal of keeping track of the upgrades I have bought and having it save. It will also work if the upgrades API has more items added.
